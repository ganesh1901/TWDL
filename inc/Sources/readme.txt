===========================================================
OVERVIEW
===========================================================
The AceXtreme software distribution provides user access to the
DDC AceXtreme family of devices running on the Linux operating
system.  Refer to the BU-69092 Software Manual for programming
features and guidelines.

For the following scenarios, assume the installation directory is
named 'DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b' in the user's home directory.


===========================================================
Software Installation and Uninstallation
===========================================================
Refer to the ~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/docs/install.txt file
included with the distribution archive for installation and
uninstallation instructions.


===========================================================
Device Drivers
===========================================================
The device driver source code for the various supported devices is
located in the 'drivers' directory found in the installation directory.
In order to utilize a particular device, the appropriate driver must be
built, installed onto the system, and loaded into the running kernel.

    NOTE: The drivers must be built against a kernel source tree of
          the same version and configuration as the currently
          running kernel.

There are two types of drivers:

    1. ACEX Drivers       Located in the 'drivers/acex' directory
       - acexpci
         - BU-67101Q        - BU-67112X        - BU-67210BF/M
         - BU-67104/5C      - BU-67114H        - BU-67210F/M
         - BU-67106BK       - BU-67118F/M      - BU-67301B
         - BU-67106K        - BU-67118Y/Z      - DD-40000K
         - BU-67107F/M      - BU-67120N        - DD-40100F
         - BU-67108/9C      - BU-67206BK
         - BU-67110F/M      - BU-67206K

    2. Legacy Drivers     Located in the 'drivers/legacy' directory
       - acexusb          - e2mausb          - emapci 
         - BU-67102/3U      - BU-65590U        - BU-65566H
         - BU-67113U        - BU-65591U        - BU-65586N
         - BU-67202U                           - BU-65596/97F/M
         - BU-67211U

The following build steps apply to both types of drivers:

    NOTE: [ ] = optional   < > = required

    1. Enter 'root' user session:
        su

    2. Build driver:
        make [NAME=<drivername> DEBUG=<debug>] <target>

            [NAME=<drivername> DEBUG=<debug>] applies to ACEX Drivers only

                <drivername>
                    acexpci

                <debug>
                    0 - Debug Printing Disabled (default if DEBUG not specified)
                    1 - Debug Printing Enabled

            <target>
                all             make the clean driver, install and load it to system
                clean           delete all files generated by make
                build           make the clean driver *.ko, default
                unload          unload driver
                install         copy driver *.ko file to /usr/lib/ddc
                uninstall       delete driver *.ko file from /usr/lib/ddc
                load            load driver
                cleanupcache    clean cached information

       To print the help information:
        make help

    3. Terminate 'root' user session:
        exit

Examples for ACEX Drivers:

    To change to the driver build directory:
        cd ~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/drivers/acex/prj

    To make the acexpci debug driver:
        su
        make NAME=acexpci DEBUG=1
        exit

    To make, install, and load the acexpci release driver:
        su
        make NAME=acexpci all
        exit

    To load the acexpci driver:
        su
        make NAME=acexpci load
        exit

    To unload the acexpci driver:
        su
        make NAME=acexpci unload
        exit

Examples for Legacy Drivers:

    To change to the driver build directory:

        For the USB AceXtreme based devices:
            cd ~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/drivers/legacy/acexusb

        For the USB FlexCore based devices:
            cd ~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/drivers/legacy/e2mausb

        For the PCI/PMC Enhanced Mini-ACE based devices:
            cd ~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/drivers/legacy/emapci

    To make the driver only:
        su
        make
        exit

    To make, install, and load the release driver:
        su
        make all
        exit

    To load the driver:
        su
        make load
        exit

    To unload the driver:
        su
        make unload
        exit

    NOTE: The PCI/PMC FlexCore based devices are not supported in this release.

Example of an alternative method of loading and unloading the drivers:

    For PCI/PMC/PCIe/XMC AceXtreme based devices:
        su
        /usr/sbin/ddc_acexpci_load
        exit
        
        su
        /usr/sbin/ddc_acexpci_unload
        exit

    For USB AceXtreme based devices:
        su
        insmod acexusb.ko
        exit
        
        su
        rmmod acexusb
        exit

    For USB FlexCore based devices:
        su
        insmod e2mausb.ko
        exit
        
        su
        rmmod e2mausb
        exit
        
    For PCI/PMC Enhanced Mini-ACE based devices:
        su
        /usr/sbin/ddc_emapci_load
        exit
        
        su
        /usr/sbin/ddc_emapci_unload
        exit

    NOTE: The drivers must be loaded after every system startup.
          The loader script can be executed automatically during
          system boot by calling it from the system 'rc' startup
          facility.


===========================================================
Card Manager
===========================================================
Once a particular device has been properly installed in a system,
the card manager program 'ddccm' must be built, installed, and
run in order to assign logical device numbers to any DDC device(s).

The following build steps apply to the Card Manager:

    NOTE: [ ] = optional   < > = required

    1. Enter 'root' user session:
        su

    2. Build the Card Manager:
        make <target>

            <target>
                all             make and install release Card Manager, default
                clean           delete all files generated by make
                debug           make debug Card Manager
                install         copy ddccm file to /usr/sbin
                uninstall       delete ddccm file from /usr/sbin
                cleanupcache    clean cached information

       To print the help information:
        make help

    3. Terminate 'root' user session:
        exit

Examples for building the Card Manager:

    Change to the Card Manager directory:
        cd ~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/ddccm/prj

    To build and install the release version of the Card Manager:
        su
        make
        exit

    To make the debug version of the Card Manager:
        su
        make debug
        exit

    To uninstall the Card Manager:
        su
        make uninstall
        exit


===========================================================
Run-Time Library
===========================================================
Upon installation, the RTL header files are available in the
installation location, ~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/libraries/emacepl/src.

For library versions 3.9.0 and up, the user must execute script
~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/tools/install-emacepl.sh to install
library binaries (libemacepl.a, libemacepl.so) and create
include file directory link /usr/include/emacepl.

Any programs that utilize the RTL routines must be linked with
this library, either statically by including the precise name
of the binary on the program build command line
'... /usr/lib/libemacepl.a', or by linking to it via the system
dynamic library cache by using the '-lemacepl' command line
option.  The POSIX Threads library must also be linked into
any programs that rely upon the BU-69092 RTL by including the
'-lpthread' option to the compile stage command line.  Refer
to the sample program 'Makefile' for further details.

User developed programs should include the following BU-69092
header files:

    #include "stdemace.h"
    #include "ddc_os_lib_util.h"        (optional)


===========================================================
RTL Samples
===========================================================
A number of programs are provided in source code form for
demonstration purposes of the various features of the DDC
devices. The programs are built as follows:

   Change to the samples project directory:
      cd ~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/samples/emacepl/prj

   Build all programs:
      make

Each one can be executed by changing to the "samples/emacepl/bin"
directory and running the binary by prepending './' to the
executable file name on the command line.

    NOTE: All program source files are designed to be compiled on
          all of the supported operating systems.


===========================================================
ACE Support Library
===========================================================
Upon installation, the RTL header files are available in the
installed location, ~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/libraries/acetoemace/src.

For library versions 3.9.0 and up, the user must execute script
~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/tools/install-acetoemace.sh to install
library binaries (libace.a, libace.so) and create include file
directory link /usr/include/ace.

Any programs that utilize the ACE Support library must be linked with
this library, as well as the RTL libemacepl.a or libemacepl.so.

User developed programs should include the following acetoemace
header file:

    #include "stdace.h"


===========================================================
ACE Samples
===========================================================
There are a number of samples programs demonstrating the
various features of the ACE library. They are built as
follows:

   Change to the ACE to EMACE directory:
      cd ~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/samples/acetoemace/prj

   Build all samples:
      make

All the samples are built in the "bin" directory and
can be executed from there.


===========================================================
TstSim Support Library
===========================================================
Upon installation, the TstSim Support header files are available
in the installed location, ~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/libraries/tstsim/src.

For library versions 3.9.0 and up, the user must execute script
~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/tools/install-tstsim.sh to install
library binaries (libtstsim.a, libtstsim.so) and create include
file directory link (/usr/include/tstsim).

Any programs that utilize the TstSim Support library must be linked
with this library, as well as the RTL libemacepl.a or libemacepl.so.

User developed programs should include the following tstsim
header file:

    #include "ts_drv.h"


===========================================================
TstSim Samples
===========================================================
There are a number of samples programs demonstrating the
various features of the TstSim library. They are build as
follows:

   Change to the tstsim directory:
      cd ~/DDC1553[S,D]1_x_y_z_b/samples/tstsim/prj

   Build all samples:
      make

All the samples are built in the "bin" directory and
can be executed from there.


===========================================================
DDK Library Projects
===========================================================
The DDK distribution includes the source code for the
following library projects:
    Run-Time Library
    ACE Support Library
    TstSim Support Library

Because Run-Time Library is the base library for both
ACE Support Library and TstSim Support Library, the
Run-Time Library must be installed before ACE Support
Library and TstSim Support Library can be re-built.

The following steps show how to rebuild the library:

    NOTE: [ ] = optional   < > = required

    1. Enter 'root' user session:
        su

    2. Build the library:
        make <target>

            <target>
                all             make release library and install it, default
                mklink          create library links
                rmlink          delete library links
                libs            build library binaries
                clean           delete all files generated by make
                debug           make debug library binary
                install         copy library binaries to ../bin/$PLATFORM/
                                and install them
                uninstall       uninstall library binaries
                cleanupcache    clean cached information

       To print the help information:
        make help
